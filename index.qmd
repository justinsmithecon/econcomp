## Overview

### Description

In the 2023-24 year, Laurier Economics is launching its inaugural student competition. We plan on running this competition annually to create a fun learning experience for students outside of the classroom.

The objective of this year's competition is to predict immigration levels in Canadian census sub-divisions (equivalent to municipalities). Immigration is an important public policy issue in Canada, and we believe that there could be significant benefits to the development of a model that accurately estimates how many immigrants will settle in a particular municipality.

### How to Participate

-   Sign up your team <!-- [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](https://wlu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bkqkuIJ6QbzfWRM) -->
-   Download the data [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](#sec-data)
-   Create your model and generate predictions
-   Submit your predictions [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](#sec-submit)

### Evaluation

Each submission is scored on its **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, a measure of the average error of the prediction. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins.

### Timeline

The competition will run for the whole academic year, but there will be two opportunities to sign up: once in the fall term, and once in the winter term. As an incentive to sign up in the fall, interim prizes will be distributed to the top team at the end of the fall semester.

-   **First Team Sign Up Window** - September 27, 2023 - October 20, 2023
-   **Competition Opens** - October 21, 2023
-   **Interim Prize Deadline** - 11:59pm, December 6, 2023
-   **Second Team Sign Up Window** - January 8, 2024 - January 29, 2024
-   **Competition Closes** - 11:59pm, March 1, 2024.

### Prizes

Prizes are allocated separately by year level of the team members. If a team has a mix of year levels, the prize is allocated to the highest year level of the team members. Year levels are: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, Masters.

-   Interim Prizes

    -   **1st Place at Each Year Level**: Swag (including a Stata Shirt and Lazaridis Swag).

-   Final Prizes

    -   **1st Place at Each Year Level**: \$300 split between team members.

## Data {#sec-data}

The underlying data for the competition is the 2021 Canada Census. Statistics Canada provides various public use versions of this data, including public use microdata files, and "profiles," which are aggregated Census records at a specific level of geography. The competition uses the profile for Census Sub-Divisions, which are the same as municipalities.

The data have been separated into a "test" dataset and an "evaluation" dataset. You will create and train your model with the test dataset, which consists of half of the municipalities chosen at random, and includes: a) a host of Census variables that you will use as inputs into your model, and b) the level of immigration that you are trying to predict (col87 in the test dataset). Once you have a submission ready you will generate your predictions with the evaluation dataset, which consists of the other half of the municipalities, and only includes the Census inputs. The true immigration levels in the evaluation data are hidden from competitors.

When you submit your predictions based on the evaluation data, we will compute the RMSE using the true immigration levels for those records and report it on the leaderboard at the end of each day.

A codebook that describes each variable is here: [codebook_testdata.xlsx](data/codebook_testdata.xlsx)

## Submissions {#sec-submit}

All submissions must be in **.csv** format, and contain only two columns: 1) **csdid**, the numeric ID number for the municipality; 2) **pimm**, the prediction of immigration levels for that municipality.

The .csv files must be named with your group name in all lower case letters and no spaces. For instance, if your team name is "The Deadweight Losses" then your submissions must all be named **thedeadweightlosses.csv**

Submit your .csv files here: [link to submission form](https://forms.gle/azMhqbfM1xNsiK546)

## Rules

**Students can only belong to one team**

A student can only be on a single team

**No sharing code privately between teams**

Each team must work independently to complete the predictions.

**Team limits**

Teams of up to 3 students are allowed.

**Data**

Teams can only use the data provided to create your models. No external data is permitted.

**Eligibility**

Eligible participants are Laurier students whose major is Economics, Economics and Accounting, Economics and Financial Management, Economics and Data Analytics, or Master of Arts in Business Economics during the signup period. If a student subsequently switches programs but remains enrolled at the university, they can remain in the competition.

**Submitting Code**

Students must provide the code that generated their predictions for their final submission only. The code must run and generate the submitted output, otherwise the team is disqualified.

## Overview

### Description

Welcome to the second annual Students Mastering Intriguing Testable Hypoheses (SMITH) competition.  We run this event annually to create a fun learning experience for Laurier Economics students outside of the classroom.

The objective of this year's competition is to predict individual hourly wages using the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS). Economists have studied the determinants of wages for decades - in particular the relationship between education and wages - since labour compensation is the main way individuals are compensated for their work and therefore how they support themselves and their families.  Knowing more about what determines wages can help answer questions about income inequality and upward mobility.

### How to Participate

-   Sign up your team <!-- [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](https://wlu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7ZMqcJ1qKIHhwfI) -->
-   Download the data [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](#sec-data)
-   Create your model and generate predictions
-   Submit your predictions [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](#sec-submit)

### Evaluation

Each submission is scored on its **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, a measure of the average error of the prediction. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins.

### Timeline

The competition will run through most of the Winter 2025 semester.  See below for key dates:

-   **Sign Up Window** - January 6, 2025 to January 24, 2025 
-   **Competition Opens** - January 27, 2025
-   **Competition Closes** - 11:59pm, March 21, 2025.

### Prizes

Prizes are allocated separately by year level of the team members. If a team has a mix of year levels, the prize is allocated to the highest year level of the team members. Year levels are: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

-   **1st Place at Each Year Level**: \$300 split between team members.

Your achievement will also be celebrated at a year-end event where we will celebrate the accomplishments of economics students over the past academic year.

## Data {#sec-data}

The underlying data for the competition is the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS), a monthly survey of about 50,000 households on matters related to employment that forms the primary source of information on the Canadian labour market.  

You are provided with two datasets: 1) the "training" data, and 2) the "evaluation" data. You will create and estimate your model with the training dataset, which is the March 2024 LFS filtered to include only full-time, full-year workers.  Once you have a submission ready you will generate your predictions for wages with the evaluation dataset, which is the LFS from a different month which for now will remain hidden. Both datasets contain the same variables, except the evaluation data does not contain wages, which is the variable you are predicting.

When you submit your predictions based on the evaluation data, we will compute the RMSE using the true wages for those records and report it on the leaderboard at the end of each day.

## Submissions {#sec-submit}

All submissions must be in **.csv** format, and contain only two columns: 1) **rec_num**, the numeric ID number for the person; 2) **phrlyearn**, the prediction of wages for the individual.

The .csv files must be named with your group name in all lower case letters and no spaces. For instance, if your team name is "The Deadweight Losses" then your submissions must all be named **thedeadweightlosses.csv**

Submit your .csv files here: [link to submission form](https://forms.gle/azMhqbfM1xNsiK546)



## Questions

If you have any questions about the competition or require help with your predictions, contact <a href="mailto:jusmith@wlu.ca">jusmith@wlu.ca</a>

## Rules

**Students can only belong to one team**

A student can only be on a single team

**No sharing code privately between teams**

Each team must work independently to complete the predictions.

**Team limits**

Teams of up to 3 students are allowed.

**Data**

Teams can only use the data provided to create your models. No external data is permitted.

**Eligibility**

Eligible participants are Laurier undergraduate students whose **major** is Economics, Economics and Accounting, Economics and Financial Management, and Economics and Data Analytics during the signup period. If a student subsequently switches programs but remains enrolled at the university, they can remain in the competition.

**Submitting Code**

Students must provide the code that generated their predictions for their final submission only. The code must run and generate the submitted output, otherwise the team is disqualified.

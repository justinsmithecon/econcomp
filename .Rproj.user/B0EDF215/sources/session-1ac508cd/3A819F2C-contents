## Overview

### Description

In the 2023-24 year, Laurier Economics is launching its inaugural student competition.  We plan on running this competition annually to create a fun learning experience for students outside of the classroom.

The objective of this year's competition is to predict immigration levels in Canadian census sub-divisions (equivalent to municipalities).  Immigration is important public policy issue in Canada, and we believe that there could be significant benefits to the development of a model that accurately estimates how many immigrants will settle in a particular municipality.

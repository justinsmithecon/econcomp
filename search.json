    "text": "Welcome to the third annual Students Mastering Intriguing Testable Hypoheses (SMITH) competition. We run this event annually to create a fun learning experience for Laurier Economics students outside of the classroom.\nThe objective of this year’s competition is to predict end of season winning percentage by team in the NHL using information available at the beginning of a season. Professional sports provide a natural laboratory for economic analysis. NHL teams operate under budget constraints, face uncertainty, and must make forward-looking decisions using imperfect information. Using only information available before the season begins, participants are asked to forecast team performance out of sample. The goal is not to explain past outcomes, but to make accurate predictions under uncertainty, applying core economic ideas. The methods used here mirror those economists use to forecast employment, productivity, and growth in real-world settings.\n\n\n\n\nSign up your team \nDownload the data \nCreate your model and generate predictions\nSubmit your predictions \n\n\n\n\nEach submission is scored on its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a measure of the average error of the prediction. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins.\n\n\n\nThe competition will run through the Winter 2026 semester. See below for key dates:\n\nSign Up Window - February 6, 2026 to February 20, 2026 (CLOSED)\nCompetition Opens - February 23, 2026\nCompetition Closes - 11:59pm, March 27, 2026.\n\n\n\n\nPrizes are allocated separately by year level of the team members. If a team has a mix of year levels, the prize is allocated to the highest year level of the team members. Year levels are: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and Masters.\n\n1st Place at Each Year Level: $300 split between team members.\n\nYour achievement will also be celebrated at a year-end event where we will celebrate the accomplishments of economics students over the past academic year.",

    "text": "Data\nThe underlying data for the competition is a collection of NHL team stats downloaded from Natural Stattrick.\nYou are provided with two datasets: 1) the “training” data, and 2) the “evaluation” data. You will create and estimate your model with the training dataset, which for the 2014-15 through the 2023-24 seasons has current year winning percentage, a large set of statistics for the previous season, and the average of those same statistics for the prior three seasons. Once you have a submission ready you will generate your predictions for winning percentage for the 24-25 season with the evaluation dataset, which has all the same variables as the training dataset minus the current season winning percentage.\nWhen you submit your predictions based on the evaluation data, we will compute the RMSE using the true 24-25 winning percentage for those records and report it on the leaderboard at the end of each day.\nDownload the data in your preferred format below.\n\n\n\nFile Type\nTraining Data\nEvaluation Data\n\n\ncsv\ntrain.csv\neval.csv\n\n\ndta\ntrain.dta\neval.dta\n\n\n\nA data dictionary that describes each variable is here: Data Dictionary",

No external data is permitted.\nEligibility\nEligible participants are Laurier undergraduate students whose major is Economics, Economics and Accounting, Economics and Financial Management, and Economics and Data Analytics during the signup period. If a student subsequently switches programs but remains enrolled at the university, they can remain in the competition.\nSubmitting Code\nStudents must provide the code that generated their predictions for their final submission only. The code must run and generate the submitted output, otherwise the team is disqualified.",

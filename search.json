We plan on running this competition annually to create a fun learning experience for students outside of the classroom.\nThe objective of this year’s competition is to predict immigration levels in Canadian census sub-divisions (equivalent to municipalities). Immigration is important public policy issue in Canada, and we believe that there could be significant benefits to the development of a model that accurately estimates how many immigrants will settle in a particular municipality.\n\n\n\n\nSign up your team \nDownload the data \nCreate your model and generate predictions\nSubmit your predictions \n\n\n\n\nEach submission is scored on its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a measure of the average error of the prediction. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins.\n\n\n\n\nSign Up a Team - September 11, 2023 - October 1, 2023\nCreate Model and Submit Predictions - October 1, 2023 - March 1, 2024\nCompetition Deadline - 11:59pm, March 1, 2024.\nWinners Announced - TBA\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Place: $600 split between team members, plus Laurier Economics swag.\n2nd Place: $150 split between team members, plus Laurier Economics swag.\n\nAdditional Laurier Economics swag will be provided through a random draw among participating teams."

    "text": "Data\nThe underlying data for the competition is the 2021 Canada Census. Statistics Canada provides various public use versions of this data, including public use microdata files, and “profiles,” which are aggregated Census records at a specific level of geography. The competition uses the profile for Census Sub-Divisions, which are the same as municipalities.\nThe data have been separated into a “test” dataset and an “evaluation” dataset. You will create and train your model with the test dataset, which consists of half of the municipalities chosen at random, and includes: a) a host of Census variables that you will use as inputs into your model, and b) the level of immigration that you are trying to predict. Once you have a submission ready you will generate your predictions with the evaluation dataset, which consists of the other half of the municipalities, and only includes the Census inputs. The true immigration levels in the evaluation data are hidden from competitors.\nWhen you submit your predictions based on the evaluation data, we will compute the RMSE using the true immigration levels for those records and report it on the leaderboard at the end of each day.\nDownload the data in your preferred format below.\n\n\n\nFile Type\nTest Data\nEvaluation Data\n\n\ncsv\ntestdata.csv\nevaldata.csv\n\n\ndta\ntestdata.dta\nevaldata.dta\n\n\n\nA codebook that describes each variable is here: codebook_testdata.xlsx"

No external data is permitted.\nEligibility\nEligible participants are Laurier students whose major is Economics, Economics and Accounting, Economics and Financial Management, Economics and Data Analytics, or Master of Arts in Business Economics during the signup period. If a student subsequently switches programs but remains enrolled at the university, they can remain in the competition.\nSubmitting Code\nStudents must provide the code that generated their predictions for their final submission only. The code must run and generate the submitted output, otherwise the team is disqualified."

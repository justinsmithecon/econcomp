    "text": "In the 2023-24 year, Laurier Economics is launching its inaugural student competition. We plan on running this competition annually to create a fun learning experience for students outside of the classroom.\nThe objective of this year’s competition is to predict immigration levels in Canadian census sub-divisions (equivalent to municipalities). Immigration is an important public policy issue in Canada, and we believe that there could be significant benefits to the development of a model that accurately estimates how many immigrants will settle in a particular municipality.\n\n\n\n\nSign up your team \nDownload the data \nCreate your model and generate predictions\nSubmit your predictions \n\n\n\n\nEach submission is scored on its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a measure of the average error of the prediction. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins.\n\n\n\nThe competition will run for the whole academic year, but there will be two opportunities to sign up: once in the fall term, and once in the winter term. As an incentive to sign up in the fall, interim prizes will be distributed to the top team at the end of the fall semester.\n\nFirst Team Sign Up Window - September 27, 2023 - October 20, 2023\nCompetition Opens - October 21, 2023\nInterim Prize Deadline - 11:59pm, December 6, 2023\nSecond Team Sign Up Window - January 8, 2024 - January 29, 2024\nCompetition Closes - 11:59pm, March 22, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nPrizes are allocated separately by year level of the team members. If a team has a mix of year levels, the prize is allocated to the highest year level of the team members. Year levels are: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, Masters.\n\nInterim Prizes\n\n1st Place at Each Year Level: Swag (including a Stata Shirt and Lazaridis Swag).\n\nFinal Prizes\n\n1st Place at Each Year Level: $300 split between team members.",

    "text": "Data\nThe underlying data for the competition is the 2021 Canada Census. Statistics Canada provides various public use versions of this data, including public use microdata files, and “profiles,” which are aggregated Census records at a specific level of geography. The competition uses the profile for Census Sub-Divisions, which are the same as municipalities.\nThe data have been separated into a “test” dataset and an “evaluation” dataset. You will create and train your model with the test dataset, which consists of half of the municipalities chosen at random, and includes: a) a host of Census variables that you will use as inputs into your model, and b) the level of immigration that you are trying to predict (col87 in the test dataset). Once you have a submission ready you will generate your predictions with the evaluation dataset, which consists of the other half of the municipalities, and only includes the Census inputs. The true immigration levels in the evaluation data are hidden from competitors.\nWhen you submit your predictions based on the evaluation data, we will compute the RMSE using the true immigration levels for those records and report it on the leaderboard at the end of each day.\nDownload the data in your preferred format below.\n\n\n\nFile Type\nTest Data\nEvaluation Data\n\n\ncsv\ntestdata.csv\nevaldata.csv\n\n\ndta\ntestdata.dta\nevaldata.dta\n\n\n\nA codebook that describes each variable is here: codebook_testdata.xlsx",

The code must run and generate the submitted output, otherwise the team is disqualified.",

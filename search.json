    "text": "Welcome to the second annual Students Mastering Intriguing Testable Hypoheses (SMITH) competition. We run this event annually to create a fun learning experience for Laurier Economics students outside of the classroom.\nThe objective of this year’s competition is to predict individual hourly wages using the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS). Economists have studied the determinants of wages for decades - in particular the relationship between education and wages - since labour compensation is the main way individuals are compensated for their work and therefore how they support themselves and their families. Knowing more about what determines wages can help answer questions about income inequality and upward mobility.\n\n\n\n\nSign up your team \nDownload the data \nCreate your model and generate predictions\nSubmit your predictions \n\n\n\n\nEach submission is scored on its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a measure of the average error of the prediction. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins.\n\n\n\nThe competition will run through most of the Winter 2025 semester. See below for key dates:\n\nSign Up Window - January 6, 2025 to January 24, 2025\nCompetition Opens - January 27, 2025\nCompetition Closes - 11:59pm, March 21, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nPrizes are allocated separately by year level of the team members. If a team has a mix of year levels, the prize is allocated to the highest year level of the team members. Year levels are: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.\n\n1st Place at Each Year Level: $300 split between team members.\n\nYour achievement will also be celebrated at a year-end event where we will celebrate the accomplishments of economics students over the past academic year.",

    "text": "Data\nThe underlying data for the competition is the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS), a monthly survey of about 50,000 households on matters related to employment that forms the primary source of information on the Canadian labour market.\nYou are provided with two datasets: 1) the “training” data, and 2) the “evaluation” data. You will create and estimate your model with the training dataset, which is the March 2024 LFS filtered to include only full-time, full-year workers. Once you have a submission ready you will generate your predictions for wages with the evaluation dataset, which is the LFS from a different month which for now will remain hidden. Both datasets contain the same variables, except the evaluation data does not contain wages, which is the variable you are predicting.\nWhen you submit your predictions based on the evaluation data, we will compute the RMSE using the true wages for those records and report it on the leaderboard at the end of each day.\nDownload the data in your preferred format below.\n\n\n\nFile Type\nTraining Data\nEvaluation Data\n\n\ncsv\ntraindata.csv\nevaldata.csv\n\n\ndta\ntraindata.dta\nevaldata.dta\n\n\n\nA website that describes each variable is here: March 2024 Labour Force Survey",

No external data is permitted.\nEligibility\nEligible participants are Laurier undergraduate students whose major is Economics, Economics and Accounting, Economics and Financial Management, and Economics and Data Analytics during the signup period. If a student subsequently switches programs but remains enrolled at the university, they can remain in the competition.\nSubmitting Code\nStudents must provide the code that generated their predictions for their final submission only. The code must run and generate the submitted output, otherwise the team is disqualified.",

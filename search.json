We plan on running this competition annually to create a fun learning experience for students outside of the classroom.\nThe objective of this year’s competition is to predict immigration levels in Canadian census sub-divisions (equivalent to municipalities). Immigration is important public policy issue in Canada, and we believe that there could be significant benefits to the development of a model that accurately estimates how many immigrants will settle in a particular municipality.\n\n\n\nEach submission is scored on its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)*. The submission with the lowest RMSE wins."
